# Learn HTML

> Follow W3School's html tutorial https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp

It's the first time to review all the HTML knowledge since I started to work. W3School Really helps me to smooth all the history and details of HTML. So I recorded some typical code usage in the following folders.

In addition, I recorded knowledge as XMind tree format, which is put in the root folder.

There is a Chinese old saying: `Look for the old so as to learn the new.`. Wish I could always get back here.
